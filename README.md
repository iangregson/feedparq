[feedparq.club](https://feedparq.club) is a toy rss feed aggregator
that renders items in hackernews style - showing only the top K items.

Each file in the [`feedparq-rs/config`](./feedparq-rs/config/) directory 
is a list of rss/atom feeds that are aggregated and displayed on
[feedparq.club](https://feedparq.club).

e.g. the `feedparq-rs/config/news` file lists the feeds that are 
aggregated at [feedparq.club/news](https://feedparq.club/news)
