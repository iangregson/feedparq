			<title><![CDATA[Doug Aubrey - Legacy of an Invisible Bullet]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali was joined by BAFTA-nominated filmmaker Doug Aubrey to talk about &#39;Legacy of an Invisible Bullet&#39;, which is described as &quot;an immersive 10 ½ hour cinematic experience&quot; compiled of 170 short films shot by Doug, which is going to be shown over six days at the Glasgow Film Theatre, culminating in a UK premiere of the feature-length cut, which he describes as an &quot;existential surf movie.&quot;</p>
<p>Doug goes into detail about the project, which ranges from his early days capturing the 1970s punk scene through his time documenting disaster zones across the world, as well as his own personal disaster following a thyroid cancer diagnosis, piecing together a cinematic mosaic 50 years in the making.</p>
<p>The two also talk about the importance of sound as well as vision, the effects of people&#39;s changing viewing habits, the importance of the short film as a medium, who has inspired him over the years, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an insightful and inspirational conversation with someone who is steeped in film, and whose longevity gives him an overview of filmmaking which is rare. Hopefully it will convince you to visit the GFT and experience Doug&#39;s work for yourself.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Douglas Skelton - The Hollow Mountain & A Grave for a Thief]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! Ali spoke to crime writer, and returning guest, Douglas Skelton to talk about the latest entry in the &#39;Rebecca Connolly&#39; series of crime thrillers, &#39;The Hollow Mountain&#39; which is out now, published on the Polygon imprint of Birlinn Ltd.</p>
<p>Douglas talks about the origins of Rebecca Connolly and the inspiration behind them, the importance of place and returning to Glasgow as a setting, the true stories which are central to each novel, constructing and developing memorable characters, having a strong supporting cast, the pleasure taken in cultural referencing, and more. </p>
<p>The two also discuss Douglas&#39; other current series, the &#39;A Company of Rogues&#39; books (the latest of which is &#39;A Grave for a Thief&#39;, published by Canelo), the challenges, and the freedom, that comes with writing historical fiction, and the inspirations, (literary and otherwise) behind these books.</p>
<p>He is also very honest about the highs and lows of writing, and what&#39;s coming next. Douglas has long been one of our favourite writers, and it&#39;s always a treat to have a conversation with him. If you don&#39;t know his work then we hope this podcast will persuade you to investigate further. </p>

			<title><![CDATA[Louise Welsh - To The Dogs]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali caught up with writer, and previous guest, Louise Welsh to talk about her latest novel To The Dogs, which is out now published by Canongate Books.</p>
<p>The two talk about the complex issue of class, the hold of the past, the setting of Glasgow, the central character of Jim Brennan, the parallels between gangland life and academia, the changing politics of university life, building towards a dramatic conclusion, and much more.</p>
<p>They also discuss The Second Cut, Louise&#39;s sequel to her critically-acclaimed and much-loved debut The Cutting Room, and the return of the protagonist Rilke, as well as her role as Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Glasgow, and revisiting the Empire Cafe project 10 years on.</p>
<p>Louise is not only one of SWH!&#39;s favourite writers, but also one of our greatest supporters and it was great to have her back on the podcast. The result is an insightful and thoughtful conversation which will appeal to readers and writers alike.</p>

<p>They take us through the amazing line-up for 2024, with some of the finest bands and musicians around, as well as giving some history to the festival, and a run down of the various strands this year, which include film, workshops, talks, ceilidhs, storytelling, art exhibitions, and more.</p>
<p>Douglas and Jane-Ann also explain about the work of the Soundhouse Organisation (which they are both central to) and the importance of working with a variety of partners.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Glasgow Review of Books - CD Boyland]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali spoke to CD Boyland to hear all about The Glasgow Review of Books, and particularly the Live Hip-Hop + Poetry night which will be at Stereo in Glasgow on 26th May.</p>
<p>CD talks about the line-up, which includes Darren McGarvey, Iona Lee, Billy Letford, Imogen Stirling, Texture, and Johnny Cypher, all hosted by Loud Poets&#39; Kevin Mclean.</p>
<p>The two then talk about the work of The Glasgow Review of Books, how it began, CD&#39;s role as co-editor, how people can submit and get involved, creating a space for Gaelic and Scots writing, and so much more.</p>
<p>The Glasgow Review Of Books is a wonderful resource for anyone with an interest in literature, taking Glasgow as its starting point, but covering writers and writing on a national, and international, basis. The level of discussion and criticism is informed and accessible, and at a time when the arts are under real threat it&#39;s heartwarming to hear about the work CD, his colleagues, and the contributors do.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Paisley Book Festival 2024 - Alan Bissett & Brian Conaghan]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast - the second relating to this year&#39;s Paisley Book Festival - Ali spoke to writers Alan Bissett and Brian Conaghan, who will be at the festival alongside Graeme Armstrong as part of the Scottish Masculinities event - Sunday 28th April, 5-6pm.</p>
<p>Alan and Brian talk in detail about their latest books; &#39;Lads&#39; and &#39;Treacle Town&#39; respectively, and how they relate to the theme of masculinity. They also talk about the project where they have been involved with young people in Renfrewshire and Glasgow schools, the lessons they learned from their own experiences, the generational differences they have noticed, and the importance of conversation.</p>
<p>The three also discuss some of the novels which have helped shaped them, the work of Des Dillon, the impact of Graeme&#39;s novel &#39;The Young Team&#39;, and the importance of the culture which originates from towns on the national psyche. It&#39;s a cracking conversation which only scratches the surface of the subject, and which will hopefully whet appetites for Alan, Brian, and Graeme&#39;s event.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali spoke to Jess Orr, the Associate Programmer for the Paisley Book Festival, to learn all about this year&#39;s programme - and what a programme it is.</p>
<p>Jess explains this year&#39;s theme &#39;Imagine Something Different&#39; as well as breaking down the various strands of the festival which include &#39;The Beautiful Game&#39;, &#39;Oot and Aboot&#39;, and &#39;Ireland in Focus&#39;.</p>
<p>She also talks about the Family Day and the extensive Schools programme, before the two go into details about just some of the individual events across the festival, as well as where to find all the necessary details.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a thorough and enthusiastic conversation which really whets the appetite for what&#39;s to come. In its five-year lifespan Paisley Book Festival has quickly become a highlight of Scotland&#39;s cultural calendar, and, with events being held in new venues including Paisley Town Hall and Paisley Central Library, this years is set to be the best yet.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Martin Stewart - Double Proof]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali spoke to writer Martin Stewart about his new novel &#39;Double Proof&#39;, a Glasgow-set crime thriller that both embraces and subverts genre stereotypes and expectations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Martin talks about how he views the novel, the pressures he initially felt in setting it in Glasgow, and the joy of overcoming those, the importance of comedy in his writing, the healthy state, and diverse nature, of Scottish crime fiction, the writers who inspired him, taking the author out of the book, his approach to creating characters, and so much more.</p>
<p>The two also talk about the processes of editing and publicising a novel, writing for different readerships, encouraging and supporting the next generation of writers, and what Martin hopes is next for his protagonist Robbie Gould.</p>
<p>Better known, so far, as a children&#39;s and YA author, it was fascinating to talk to Martin about his first foray into the murky world of crime fiction, and to hear an author who clearly thinks deeply about what he writes, and how.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Hue And Cry - 40th Anniversary]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali spoke to Greg and Pat Kane, better known as Scottish musical legends Hue And Cry, to hear all about their 40th anniversary celebrations which will be happening throughout 2024.</p>
<p>As part of those celebrations they are releasing demos and rarities every month, as well as producing a documentary and other archival material, before undertaking a full-band tour later in the year.</p>
<p>The two talk about what it feels like to be making music together for four decades and the ups and downs along the way, how it all began, the surprises thrown up from their archive, their relationship with the music press, how they work together, the unforgettable memories, as well as explaining that it&#39;s always been a family affair - and there&#39;s so much more...</p>
<p>They also discuss who they listen to and admire among the up-and-coming Scottish musicians, and why they think the country&#39;s music scene is in a healthy state, something which should be celebrated far and wide - an attitude with which SWH! agrees heartily.</p>
<p>This was a really special conversation with a band of brothers who have proven to be not only survivors, but thrivers, and you get the feeling that in their 40th year they feel they are just getting started. </p>
<p>For full details, including all the ways to listen and the relevant links, go to https://www.scotswhayhae.com </p>
<p>Hue And Cry’s 40th Anniversary tour starts 10th October. The Labour Of Love series is released monthly. See https://hueandcry.co.uk for details.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the second in the Shona Sandison series of novels, following on from the critically acclaimed &#39;The Goldenacre&#39;, and Phil talks about the challenges of writing a sequel, the balance between writing something recognisable but new, the importance of first lines and grabbing readers&#39; attention, the influences on the series, writing multiple characters, and what comes next.</p>
<p>They also discuss genre writing, the uncanny, small town dynamics, writing about home, Phil&#39;s other fiction, and much more, including the current situation in terms of the arts in Scotland, and its coverage in the media.</p>
<p>The Goldenacre was one of SWH!&#39;s favourite books of 2022, and &#39;The Hollow Tree&#39; among the most anticipated for 2024, and it was such a pleasure to be able to talk to the author himself.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ajay Close - What Doesn't Kill Us]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali spoke to writer Ajay Close to talk about her latest novel &#39;What Doesn&#39;t Kill Us&#39; (published with Saraband Books). Set in Yorkshire as the 1970s became the 80s, and greatly influenced by the real-life Yorkshire Ripper investigations, Close evokes the sights, sounds, smells, and attitudes of Britain – and that part of Britain in particular – touching not only on prevalent sexism, but also class, race, and sexuality.</p>
<p>Ajay talks about the reasons for wanting to write this novel, the different aspects to it, the challenges in writing about something inspired by real-life events, her love of research, the roles of the central characters police constable Liz Seeley and artist Charmaine, and how the way a story is told can be as important as the story itself.</p>
<p>The two also talk about the themes which run through Ajay&#39;s novels, why she is attracted to people and moments from history, what fiction offers which non-fiction can&#39;t, her debut novel &#39;Forspoken&#39; (a particular favourite of Ali&#39;s), other Glasgow novels, how a writer changes throughout a career, and so much more.</p>
<p>Ajay Close has long been one of SWH!&#39;s favourite writers, and it was such a pleasure to talk to her about this latest book, and her life as a writer. If you&#39;re also a fan, this conversation is essential listening. If you aren&#39;t aware of her writing this is a great place to begin. </p>

			<title><![CDATA[Mull Historical Society - In My Mind There's A Room]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali spoke to writer and musician Colin MacIntyre, better known to most as Mull Historical Society, to talk about his amazing album &#39;In My Mind There&#39;s A Room&#39;, which brings together his twin loves of music and literature.</p>
<p>Colin describes how this album came together and the processes involved in marrying his music to the words of a number of his favourite writers, including Colin&#39;s own grandfather - the &#39;Bard of Mull&#39; - Angus Macintyre.</p>
<p>He talks warmly about his inspirational grandfather, recording these tracks in the room where Angus and his family used to live, the serendipitous series of events which accompanied the making of the record, achieving the dream of working at Abbey Road studios, and so much more.</p>
<p>The two also talk about the stories behind some of the songs as well as the upcoming series of gigs, (including one at Oran Mor on the 8th February where he will be joined by Liz Lochhead, Val McDermid and James Robertson), and the new &#39;Ivor Punch&#39; novel &#39;When the Needle Drops&#39; which will be published by Black &amp; White later this year.</p>
<p>It was such a pleasure talking to Colin and we hope you enjoy listening as much as we did recording it.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Forbes Masson - Jekyll & Hyde]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the first Scots Whay Hae! podcast of 2024 Ali spoke to actor and writer Forbes Masson to talk about his starring role in a new one-person adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s &#39;Jekyll and Hyde&#39;, which is at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh from 13-27th January before going on tour.</p>
<p>Forbes talks about the production itself, collaborating with writer Gary McNair and director Michael Fentiman, returning to the Lyceum after 20 years, the challenges of playing multiple roles, the complexities of Stevenson&#39;s text, and why it remains relevant today.</p>
<p>The production is dedicated to the late Sir Michael Boyd who was central in not only Forbes&#39; career, but in the development of modern Scottish theatre and Forbes talks warmly about their relationship, going back to the halcyon days of Glasgow&#39;s Tron Theatre in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>He also touches upon his work alongside Alan Cummings, including as double act Victor and Barry who mark their 40th anniversary with &#39;Victor &amp; Barry&#39;s Kelvinside Compendium: A Meander Down Memory Close&#39; which will be published by 404 Ink later this year.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a fascinating chat with one of the finest stage actors of the last 40 years, one which whets the appetite for this production of &#39;Jekyll and Hyde&#39;.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For our latest roundup of 2023 we look at the year in music, with Ali joined once again by musician and righteous supporter of Scottish music, Gefahrgeist&#39;s Fiona Liddell. They each pick 10 tracks to discuss which have left their mark in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Both admit they could easily have picked many, many, more examples from what was another incredible year for Scottish music, and on another day possibly would, but we hope you enjoy their musical musings, meanderings, and memories.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a Spotify playlist where you can listen to all the songs Fiona and Ali talk about, and if you like what you hear then please explore further, follow, and support the bands, musicians, artists, and labels involved. What this podcast proves is how much we would all miss them if they were gone.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Martin Green - Keli & Split the Air]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali spoke to musician and composer Martin Green about all things brass banding including the audio drama &#39;Keli&#39;, the album &#39;Split the Air&#39;, the Radio 4 documentary &#39;Banding: Love, Spit and Valve Oil&#39;, the forthcoming Celtic Connections gig, and so much more. Martin also explains how his love for brass band music came about and grew, why the music and the communities where it is from remain close despite the decline and loss of industry, the importance of listening to the voices of those involved, the making of &#39;Keli&#39;, the legacy of brass band music and why it should be better known, and making something new from the traditional. </p>
<p>He also talks about the importance of Celtic Connections to himself, and to Scottish music more generally, and being a member of legendary folk group Lau. It was such a pleasure to talk to Martin and learn all about his latest body of work which are clearly passion projects, and that passion is infectious. If you thought brass band music isn&#39;t for you, Martin Green may just change your mind.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Kevin Mclean - I AM LOUD Productions]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali spoke to Kevin Mclean, the creative director of I AM LOUD Productions (previously LOUD POETS) which, as well as continuing to host their legendary poetry nights, is now also a multi-disciplinary production and entertainment company.</p>
<p>Kevin talks about the evolvement of I AM LOUD as it approaches the tenth anniversary, the challenges faced and overcome, finding new ways of promoting and supporting performers, embracing the opportunities offered by digital technology, and their plans for the future.</p>
<p>The two also discuss Spoken Word in Scotland touching upon the history, the healthy state of the current scene, the importance of collaboration, supporting new and diverse voices, and making sure that I AM LOUD&#39;s reach is countrywide, and beyond.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an absorbing and thought-provoking conversation about an area of Scottish culture all too rarely discussed, although I AM LOUD are changing that situation, and it was such a pleasure to talk to someone as enthusiastic and knowledgable as Kevin, whose passion is palpable.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Denzil Meyrick - Murder at Holly House]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali spoke to returning guest, the writer Denzil Meyrick.</p>
<p>Denzil has a new novel &#39;Murder at Holly House&#39; out, published on the Bantam Press imprint of Transworld Publishers.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been described by some as &#39;cosy crime&#39; (although, as the two discuss, that term is an inadequate description) and is a departure from Denzil&#39;s more hard-nosed thrillers, and it was fascinating to talk to him about this change of styles, and</p>
<p>The two also talk about the future of DCI Daley (including the move to TV), the various influences on &#39;Murder at Holly House&#39;, creating the central character of Frank Grasby, setting the action in Yorkshire - and in the 1950s - his Kinloch novellas (now collected in paperback with Polygon Books), and the exciting news about what&#39;s coming next.</p>
<p>It&#39;s always a pleasure to catch up with Denzil Meyrick, one of the finest writers around, and we hope you enjoy listening as much as we did talking.</p>
<p>And keep listening to the very end as there&#39;s a bonus clip from the audiobook of &#39;Murder at Holly House&#39;, which is narrated by Tom Turner - with thanks to publishers Transworld for providing it.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[David Manderson & Ricky Monahan Brown - Carl MacDougall - Already, Too Late]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali spoke to writers David Manderson and Ricky Monahan Brown to talk about the late, great, Carl MacDougall and his wonderful memoir Already, Too Late: A Boyhood Memoir.</p>
<p>Both men talk about their relationship, and friendship, with Carl, and how he inspired, supported, and encouraged not just them but many other writers, and many others, before setting out just a few of his achievements as a writer, educator, journalist, critic, television presenter, president of Scottish PEN, and much more.</p>
<p>The discussion then turns to the memoir itself, Already, Too Late: A Boyhood Memoir, (which is an exemplary example of the form) and how it explains and gives clues to the man Carl MacDougall would become. It was a joyous conversation to be a part of, one which celebrated and remembered a man who was central to Scottish literature and culture more widely.</p>
<p>If you knew Carl and his incredible work then we hope you can enjoy these stories and memories, and ponder your own. If you aren&#39;t yet familiar then we hope this will inspire you to investigate for yourselves.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Elisabeth Schilling & Louise Ahl - Hear Eyes Move: Dances with Ligeti/Skunk without k is Sun]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast is an interview with two choreographers and theatre makers, Elisabeth Schilling &amp; Louise Ahl, about their respective new shows &#39;Hear Eyes Move: Dances with Ligeti&#39; and &#39;Skunk without k is Sun&#39;.</p>
<p>First of all Elisabeth talks about why she chose to celebrate the music of György Ligeti in &#39;Hear Eyes Move&#39;, what she sees as his legacy, performing the show across Europe, theatrical inspirations, why returning to perform in Scotland is so important, and more.</p>
<p>Then Louise explains &#39;Skunk without k is Sun&#39; - a new experimental solo opera work which will be performed as part of the Take Me Somewhere Festival 2023. She also talks about how she came to opera, wanting to make it more accessible (and subvert people&#39;s ideas about it), the technical and physical demands of the piece, and how previous work will feed into this new performance.</p>
<p>Individually you&#39;ll learn about two exciting new shows coming soon, but taken together these interviews give just a glimpse of what&#39;s going on in terms of experimental dance/theatre in Scotland today.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Then Louise explains &amp;#39;Skunk without k is Sun&amp;#39; - a new experimental solo opera work which will be performed as part of the Take Me Somewhere Festival 2023. She also talks about how she came to opera, wanting to make it more accessible (and subvert people&amp;#39;s ideas about it), the technical and physical demands of the piece, and how previous work will feed into this new performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individually you&amp;#39;ll learn about two exciting new shows coming soon, but taken together these interviews give just a glimpse of what&amp;#39;s going on in terms of experimental dance/theatre in Scotland today.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Ron Butlin - So Many Lives and All of Them Are Yours]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali caught up with previous guest, novelist and poet Ron Butlin, to talk about his latest book &#39;So Many Lives and All of Them Are Yours&#39; the surprise sequel (&amp; prequel) to 1987&#39;s &#39;The Sound of My Voice&#39; - a surprise not least to Ron himself.</p>
<p>The latter is one of Ali&#39;s favourite novels so it was genuinely exciting to be able to discuss the new book and learn more about the central character of Morris Magellan.</p>
<p>Ron talks about how the book came to be, his wife&#39;s (the writer Regi Claire) important role, reacquainting himself with Morris, the joy in creating new characters in familiar places, the themes he wanted to explore, writing about the unreal - or even surreal - time of Lockdown, the unintended parallels between the two books, using different narrative voices, and so much more.</p>
<p>The two also discuss the way Ron approaches writing, the differences, and similarities, between his poetry and prose, the importance of music in his life, and his desire to write more comedy - especially in these dark times.</p>
<p>Ron is such wonderful company, and it&#39;s always a pleasure to have him on the SWH! podcast. We think you&#39;ll enjoy listening as much as we did recording it.</p>
<p>Thanks must go to Birlinn for allowing us to record the podcast at their headquarters.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Paul Dalgarno - A Country of Eternal Light]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali spoke to writer Paul Dalgarno - live from his home in Melbourne - to hear all about his novel &#39;A Country of Eternal Light&#39; (published with Polygon Books). Paul sets out how he describes the book to others, the unusual nature of the storytelling, the importance of place and the way distance can lend perspective on home, how his journalism feeds into his fiction, the interlinked themes and memory and grief, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The two also discuss the role of central character Margaret Bryce and how the layers of her narration keep the reader guessing as she reassesses her family life. Paul also offers advice to those looking to get published, which will be of interest to writers and readers alike.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&#39;A Country of Eternal Light&#39; is one of the most interesting and inventive novels of the year in terms of style and content, and it was fascinating to be able to get such an insight from Paul about it.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Bloody Scotland - The McIlvanney Prize Shortlist 2023]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For our third and final Bloody Scotland podcast Ali spoke to the shorlisted writers for this year&#39;s McIlvanney Prize which is for the Scottish Crime Book of the Year.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First of all he caught up with Calum McSorley (Squeaky Clean), Craig Russell (The Devil&#39;s Playground), and Robbie Morrison (Cast A Cold Eye) to hear about their nominated novels and what it means to be on the shortlist. They also discuss the pervading influence of William McIlvanney&#39;s writing, the welcoming and supportive nature of the crime writing community, why Glasgow is such a natural setting for crime fiction, their experiences of Bloody Scotlands of the past, and what they are looking forward to this year.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later Ali spoke to the fourth shortlisted writer, previous podcast guest Denise Mina, to talk about her nominated novel &#39;The Second Murderer&#39; and its inclusion on the McIlvanney Prize Shortlist, but they discuss so much more - including Denise&#39;s thoughts on literary prizes, her experiences of Bloody Scotland, and the challenges of setting a novel in an LA which no longer exists. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When brought together the conversations makes for essential listening for anyone with an interest in books - crime related or otherwise - as it was such a treat to talk in depth with four fascinating and very different writers.</p>

<p>Sharing a love of food and cooking, the two also discuss their food philosophies, the importance of seasonal produce, the adaptability of national cuisines, and why simplicity is often the key to good cooking. &#39;Magnaccioni: My Food...

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali catches up with writer Denise Mina to talk about her new historical novel &#39;Three Fires&#39;, which is published by Polygon Books.</p>
<p>Following on from the equally compelling &#39;Rizzio&#39;, &#39;Three Fires&#39; takes a historical figure and uses significant events from the past to comment and question the present day. Denise talks about the central, complex, character of Girolamo Savonarola and how his ideas, and the resulting actions and following he inspired, are still felt today. She also talks about her approach to writing historical fiction, the satisfaction in writing complicated individuals, the joy of research, bringing the past and the present together, and so much more.</p>
<p>The two also talk about Denise&#39;s new Philip Marlowe novel &#39;The Second Murderer&#39;, (which is published by Harvill Secker), and the challenges in writing someone else&#39;s character.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a warm and informative conversation with one of Scotland&#39;s finest and favourite writers, and it was such a pleasure to talk to Denise about her latest work.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! Podcast Ali talks to director Pauline Lynch and actor Fletcher Mathers about the new Scots language theatre company Braw Clan, and the forthcoming production &#39;Secret Wrapped In Lead&#39; which will be touring throughout the Clydesdale district in July.</p>
<p>The play, which is written by Martin Travers, is based on the true story of Dorothy and William Wordsworth&#39;s visit to Leadhills in 1803, and Pauline and Fletcher tell us what they can about the story (avoiding spoilers), the challenges faced in getting the play from the page to the stage, as well as breaking down their own roles.</p>
<p>They also discuss the formation of Braw Clan, the importance of keeping it local, the various dates on the tour, why Scots is at the heart of what they do, the sense of community which drives the company, and their hopes and plans for the future. It&#39;s exciting to hear about this new theatre company and the conversation whets the appetite for their debut production.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Difference Between Us]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali spoke to Etienne Kubwabo, the Writer/Director/Producer of the new film from Mile Away Films, &#39;The Difference Between Us&#39;, as well as some of the cast - Craig Andrew Mooney, Alex Jackson, Paul Stirrat, and Wam Siluka Jr - to learn all about this debut feature.</p>
<p>Etienne sets out the inspiration behind the film, the personal nature of the production, the collaborative process involved in filmmaking, and the importance of trust. We then get a fascinating insight into the casting process from both sides, learn why everyone was so keen to be involved in the project, the process of building characters, and relationships, on screen and off, and a whole lot more</p>
<p>It&#39;s rare to get such an appreciation of the creative process, from so many of those involved, on one podcast, and we really appreciate everyone giving up their time to talk to SWH!. It&#39;s a conversation which really whets the appetite for &#39;The Difference Between Us&#39;.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Rebecca Smith - Rural: The Lives of the Working Class Countryside]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast Ali spoke to writer Rebecca Smith about her new book &#39;Rural: The Lives of the Working Class Countryside&#39; (published by William Collins) which is part memoir, part examination of the sociopolitical construct of the countryside, something which is all too rarely written about.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Rebecca explains her reasons for writing the book, the difficulty in contextualising her childhood, cutting through the romance and mythology of rural living, the often contradictory nature of tied housing (and other economic factors of working and living in the country), the complexities of class, and more.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The two also talk about the extensive research behind the book, and a number case-studies named are explained. It was such a pleasure to talk to Rebecca about an area of British life that passes many of us by, even if we are regular visitors to the great outdoors. It&#39;s a podcast which works as a companion piece to the book, and we hope it will convince you that Rural: The Lives of the Working Class Countryside is an essential read.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[David Manderson - The Work & Life of Alan Sharp]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest podcast Ali spoke to writer and academic David Manderson to talk all things Alan Sharp, who is the subject of David&#39;s new book &#39;The Anti-hero&#39;s Journey: The Work and Life of Alan Sharp&#39;. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>David explains what drew him to write about his subject, Sharp&#39;s early life and writing, the move into radio and TV, a remarkable success in Hollywood, the mystery of the &#39;missing years&#39;, and so much more.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The two also discuss Alan Sharp&#39;s place, or rather absence, from the Scottish literary and cultural canon, and why this book is not only a timely reassessment of the man and his work, but that it will hopefully encourage further investigation and discussion into a writer too few are aware of.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;For the latest podcast Ali spoke to writer and academic David Manderson to talk all things Alan Sharp, who is the subject of David&amp;#39;s new book &amp;#39;The Anti-hero&amp;#39;s Journey: The Work and Life of Alan Sharp&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David explains what drew him to write about his subject, Sharp&amp;#39;s early life and writing, the move into radio and TV, a remarkable success in Hollywood, the mystery of the &amp;#39;missing years&amp;#39;, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two also discuss Alan Sharp&amp;#39;s place, or rather absence, from the Scottish literary and cultural canon, and why this book is not only a timely reassessment of the man and his work, but that it will hopefully encourage further investigation and discussion into a writer too few are aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest SWH! podcast Ali spoke once again to writer David F. Ross to talk about his most recent novel &#39;Dashboard Elvis Is Dead&#39;, which is out now published by Orenda Books. The two caught up in Ali&#39;s kitchen and the conversation covers David&#39;s reasons for wanting to write this book, the inspirations behind it, the strong bonds created between author and their characters, why it was important to have a Scottish strand in the plot, the challenges in writing about real events, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>They also discuss the importance of American culture in both their lives, and the complex nature of that relationship. It&#39;s always a pleasure to talk to David as there are few writers who talk about what they do with such clarity and self-reflection.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Sanne Jehoul and Duncan Cowles - Glasgow Short Film Festival 2023]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The latest SWH! podcast is all about this year&#39;s Glasgow Short Film Festival, with Ali joined by Programme Director Sanne Jehoul and filmmaker Duncan Cowles. Sanne gives us a bit of background to the festival, takes us through some of the highlights, talks about the competitions which are so important to every festival, the art of programming, the complex question as to what constitutes a &#39;short film&#39;, and so much more. Duncan tells us about the films he has screening this year, his history with the GSFF, the importance to filmmakers of festivals such as this one, and talks about what he is looking forward to this year.</p>
<p>There are also interesting conversations between the three as they discuss the impact of the pandemic on filmmakers and festivals, the return of live audiences, and the importance to individuals and the wider industry of such events. It&#39;s a conversation which goes beyond the festival itself - although all your questions should be answered - to look at just why short films are a vital and vibrant form in their own right</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest SWH! podcast Ali caught up with previous guest, writer Catriona Child, to talk about her latest novel 'Fade Into You', which is published by Luath Press.

<p>They also discuss the teenage years and how keenly everything is felt at that time, and the transition from those years into some kind of adulthood.

			<title><![CDATA[Scott Twynholm - Dog Days & Other Soundtracks - GFF23]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest podcast - the second of our Glasgow Film Festival specials - Ali catches up with musician and composer Scott Twynholm about his work on James Price's 'Dog Days' which premiered earlier in the week. Scott talks about how he came to work on 'Dog Days', collaborating with the director and editor, how every project is different and brings its own challenges, how the film was received by the audience, and where you'll be able to see if you missed it at the festival.</p>
<p>The two also discuss Scott's other film work, such as the soundtracks to 'Ride the Wave', 'Alasdair Gray: A Life In Progress' and Rachel Maclean's 'Make Me Up!', how working in theatre differs to film, his solo career and the inspirations which drive it, his early years as a member of Looper and Metrovavan, and much more. Scott is one of SWH!'s favourite musicians, one we have wanted to get on the podcast for a while. Talking about soundtracks at the Glasgow Film Festival seemed like perfect timing.</p>

<p>Martin also discusses his time as a foreign correspondent, the people and places he met, the highs and lows of the job, and a whole lot more.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest podcast, and the first of our Glasgow Film Festival podcasts for 2023, Ali spoke to Muta'Ali, the director of the documentary 'Cassius X: Becoming Ali'. The two talk about the making of the film, Muta'Ali's initial involvement, the importance of Executive Producer Mick McAvoy, working with writer Stuart Cosgrove (whose book 'Cassius X' is the inspiration for the film), the challenges posed by COVID, the relationships which shaped the young Clay/Ali, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>Muta'Ali also gives context to the film by discussing America of the time, the cultural and social tensions, the spiritual journey that the young boxer was beginning, and how he was viewed inside, and outside, the sport. It's an informative and insightful discussion about a film which is as much about social history as it is about arguably the world's greatest sporting icon.</p>

<p>'Ashes &amp; Stones' is part historical investigation, part travelogue, part memoir, and Allyson talks about all aspects of the book, why she wanted to write it, the research behind it, the importance of the various memorials she uncovered - and how their meaning and purpose has changed - and why she brought her own life into the story.</p>
<p>The two also talk about the reasons behind the Scottish witch hunts, the extent of the persecution, the collusion between the state and the church, the importance of remembrance and acknowledgment, the lessons for today, and so much more. 'Ashes &amp; Stones' is a great read, and it was fascinating to be able to talk to all about it with Allyson.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[CLR Theory,]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Each week, for the Scots Whay Hae! Radio Show, Ali interviews the artists of the week. Usually the interviews are around 10-15mins, with the unedited versions available on our YouTube channel. Last Saturday's was a chat with Gill Higgins and Hannah Jarrett-Scott from the wonderful CLR Theory, and we blethered on for nearly 40mins so we thought is was too good not to make it into a podcast episode, so here it is.</p>
<p>The three talk about how CLR Theory came to be, the forthcoming album 'Waves', the launch night at Glasgow's Glad Cafe on the 20th January (when they will be supported by the the iconic Jill Lorean), how Lockdown helped shape the band and their music, the Workers' Stories Project that they were part of, and so much more. It's such an easy conversation that it is no wonder time flew!</p>
<p>You can find links to the band, their music, and the gig at The Glad, at <a href="https://www.scotswhayhae.com" target="_blank">scotswhayhae.com</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As is traditional, the first of our Best of 2022 podcasts are all about books, and there were so many books and book-related &nbsp;things to talk about that we have split the podcast into two parts. For both, Ali is once again joined by Publishing Scotland's Vikki Reilly, and in this podcast the two talk fiction, some of the themes and trends of the year, the notable debuts, the return of some weel-kent names, and a whole lot more, as well as declaring their own choices for Book of the Year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Part II there will be further talks on crime fiction, poetry, memoirs and other non-fiction, publishing, and what we can look forward to in 2023. That will be with you soon.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Douglas MacIntyre, Grant McPhee & Neil Cooper - Hungry Beat]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest SWH! podcast Ali spoke to musician Douglas MacIntyre, filmmaker Grant McPhee, and journalist Neil Cooper to learn all about their new book 'Hungry Beat - The Scottish Independent Pop Underground Movement (1977-1984)'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's seems a shame to have the three on the same podcast as each deserves an individual interview to themselves (and that may come to pass in the future.) Douglas runs the excellent indie record label Creeping Bent as well as putting on the FRET series of concerts at the Strathaven Hotel, and has played with a number of bands over the years.</p>
<p>Grant McPhee has made three great documentaries looking at Scottish indie music, Teenage Superstars, The Glasgow School, and Big Gold Dream - the latter providing the inspiration for Hungry Beat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neil Cooper is a journalist, critic and cultural commentator who writes for the Herald, Bella Caledonia, and many other fine publications. Few have written more insightfully about, and on, Scottish culture as he has.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What follows is a fascinating and in depth conversation about what many consider the glory days of Scottish independent music, when a number of bands, musicians, and mavericks made the music world sit up and listen. Whether you were there or not this is a must listen for any music lover.</p>
<p>You can find out more, as well as out to get a copy of Hungry Beat, over at <a href="https://www.scotswhayhae.com">scotswhayhae.com</a></p>

			<title><![CDATA[Burd Ellen - A Tarot of the Green Wood]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest SWH! podcast Ali caught up with musician Debbie Armour to talk all things Burd Ellen, and their new album 'A Tarot of the Green Wood', which is out on the 31st October on Debbie's own label, Mavis Recordings. Debbie talks about the history of Burd Ellen, working with Gayle Brogan, how the new album came about, the inspiration of tarot cards, blending the traditional with the contemporary, the influences behind the music - musical and otherwise - and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>They also discuss the folk tradition, the possibility of playing the album live, and the atmosphere Burd Ellen's music creates. Burd Ellen are among the most interesting and innovative musicians around - with 'A Tarot of the Green Wood' being just the latest proof of that - and it was fascinating to get a glimpse behind the music.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[N.E. Solomons - The Bone Road]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest SWH! podcast Ali spoke to writer N.E. Solomons about her debut thriller 'The Bone Road', which is published by Polygon Books. The two talk about why she wanted to write this book, how it changed into something very different from that initial conception, the challenges in writing in this specific genre, setting events in the Balkans, the creation of the two central characters and how they work together, and parallels with the present day.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Scottish Spoken Word Showcase - Edinburgh International Book Festival]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The third of our collaborations with the Edinburgh International Book Festival is the Scottish Spoken Word Showcase Podcast - a companion to the live event of the same name. For it we interviewed six spoken word performers who tell us all about who they are, what they do, why they do it, and give us just a taste of their work. As well as those core conversations we also talk to the Director of the Edinburgh International Book Festival Nick Barley, and Alice Tarbuck from Creative Scotland.</p>
<p>Put together it offers just a small example as to the variety and diversity in the Spoken Word scene in Scotland today, and we hope you'll be encouraged to seek out, and investigate further, the work of our featured artists, and be persuaded to seek out spoken word events across the country.</p>

It is the Shaping Scotland's Stories: New Voices podcast, a companion to the live event of the same name. There are interviews with eight representatives from a variety of publishers who tell us all about who they are, what they do, the challenges and rewards of working with new literary voices, and the books they are currently excited about.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast is the first of three collaborations with the Edinburgh International Book Festival for this year's Festival. Ahead of their own event - 'Celebrating Inclusion' (Thu 25 Aug 19:00 - 20:15) - Ali spoke to writers Ever Dundas and Julie Farrell to learn more about the event, and the 'Inklusion Guide', which they have created to help event organisers better understand accessibility for disabled writers, audience members, and others.</p>
<p>It's a fascinating and insightful conversation about an area of the "Business of Books" (the name of the series that this event is part of) which is too often overlooked. Ever and Julie offer advice and anecdotes, as well as talking about their own experiences, hopes for the future, what they are looking forward to at this year's book festival, and more.</p>

Johnston to talk all about his novel 'Disnaeland', which he describes as "..a really happy story about the end of the world". D.D. talks about the inspirations behind it, how long he's been working on it, the timely nature of its publication, the influences on it, and dystopian fiction more generally. The two also discuss the themes and ideas in 'Disnaeland', as well as the philosophies - both social and moral - which drive it. D.D. also sets out why it was important for him to 'go home' to tell this story. D.D. Johnston has written one of the most unexpected, and ultimately uplifting, novels of the year. It's the end of the world as we know it, and it feels fine.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Tim Vincent-Smith & Matthew Wright - #PIANODROME]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest SWH! podcast Ali headed through to Edinburgh to visit the legendary Pianodrome, and talk to directors Tim Vincent-Smith &amp; Matthew Wright in their new home of the Old Royal High on Calton Hill. It's a stunning venue which is the perfect space and place for Pianodrome, and Tim and Matt tell us of its history and how it works, the practicalities of building it, the ethos behind what they do, and the importance of connecting, and reconnecting, artists and audiences.</p>
<p>They also talk about their 'Summer Resonancy' which is running from the 1st July to 11th September, and which include free lunchtime concerts, drop-in afternoon sessions, workshops, evening shows and a full Edinburgh Fringe Festival programme of events. Matt and Tim discuss the Fringe programme in detail and highlight just some of the strands, events, and people involved. What is made clear is that Pianodrome is not simply a stunning setting and performance space, it is a philosophy which advocates collaboration, diversity, harmony, and unity. When put together it becomes something very special indeed.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Village Storytelling Festival]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The latest SWH! podcast is all about the forthcoming Village Storytelling Festival (5 – 10 July), with Ali talking to Creative Producer Emma Collins, as well as participants and performers Raymond Wilson, Daiva Ivanuskaite, and Shona Cowie. Returning for the first time since 2017, The Village Storytelling Festival will explore Connection and Transformation – Storytelling in a Precarious World and Emma gives us an overview of this year's festival, as well as all the relevant details. Raymond, Daiva, and Shona then talk about the shows they are involved in, as well as telling us what they are looking forward to.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The festival is part of Scotland’s Year of Stories and the conversation also turns to the importance of telling stories in understanding ourselves and each other, and in building and strengthening connections. It's a genuinely inspirational conversation which not only whets the appetite for the Village Storytelling Festival, but for the future of storytelling itself.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Denzil Meyrick]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest SWH! podcast Ali spoke to writer Denzil Meyrick to talk about the publication of 'The Death of Remembrance', the 10th in the DCI Daley series of crime novels, as well as the one-off thriller 'Terms of Restitution', and the very different 'Tales of Kinloch' novellas.</p>
<p>Denzil gives us background to DCI Daley and how this series began and has progressed, the importance of the location of 'Kinloch', the development of the central characters over the novels, the importance of family in his work, and discusses the forthcoming adaptation of the series to TV.</p>
<p>The two also discuss how lockdown inspired both 'Terms of Restitution' and the 'Tales of Kinloch' books, and Denzil's desire to write something different with each. It's an insightful and enthralling interview with one of Scotland's finest writers across the genres. We hope you agree.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest SWH! podcast Ali caught up with award-winning poet, writer, and singer/songwriter Marcas Mac an Tuairneir to talk about his latest collection of poetry 'Polaris' (Leamington Books). We've been hoping to have Marcas as a guest on the podcast for a long time, so it was great to be able to speak to him about his life and work. Marcas talked not only about the themes and ideas behind 'Polaris', but also the multilingual, collaborative, and interrogative nature of the project.</p>
<p>The two also discuss Marcus's other writing, the roots of the cryptolect Polari, the pros and cons of translations, his musical career, and where Gaelic culture currently stands in relation to Scottish culture and beyond. It's a fascinating chat with one of the most interesting and thoughtful writers around.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest SWH! podcast, Ali speaks to writer and journalist Nick Holdstock to talk about his latest novel 'Quarantine' (published by Swift Press), which is set ten years after a deadly pandemic has swept the globe, in a world which is still learning to adapt. The two discuss the style and structure of 'Quarantine', writing distinct narrative voices, the initial response to the novel, the importance of offering hope even in the darkest of scenarios, and much more. Nick also talks about his journalism and how that may feed into his fiction (even if it's subliminal), and his debut novel 'The Casualties'. It's a fascinating conversation about one of the most through-provoking and arresting novels of the year, and a writer who you need to know if you don't already.</p>

Coming 7 years after Angela's acclaimed debut 'The Emergence of Judy Taylor', 'The Darlings' is a honest and insightful novel about the lasting psychological effects of childhood trauma, and our need for unconditional love. Angela goes into detail about what inspired the book, the importance of creating the central character of 'Mark', her life as a writer, the challenges she has faced, and 'casting' her books.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two also talk about Angela's upcoming Edinburgh Fringe Show 'Say If It's Not Okay', her love of performing, and what she is planning for the future.

The two talk about the links between the novel and Ruarri's songs, how the band came about after his solo career, how carefully he considers the thoughts of his younger self, the semi-autobiographical nature of the novel, and how it came to be published. Ruarri also explains the importance of music in how the story unfolds, how he tried to do something different with the form, and intriguingly hints at what is coming next. It's a very different conversation with a very different novelist, and we hope it'll prompt you to not only check out William the Conqueror the novel, but also the band.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest podcast Ali spoke to MSP and writer Alasdair Allan about his book 'Tweed Rins Tae the Ocean', which follows Alasdair and friends as they walk along the Scottish Borders from east coast to west. Along the way we not only learn about the places and people they encounter, but also about the rich history, literature, and language of these often debated lands.</p>
<p>So much more than just another travelogue, Allan's knowledge and research lifts the book to another level giving an insightful and often surprising picture of a part of Scotland which is too often consigned to the past. Alasdair Allan has managed to keep the mystery and mythology of the Borders while bringing the reader right up to date, and it was a real pleasure to be able to talk to him about the book and what inspired it.</p>

The two talk about the unusual working methods of the band, the many changes they went through, and the feverish work ethic which defined them from the start.</p>
<p>They also talk about the influence Simple Minds' music had on others, the influence of individual members, the inspiration taken from their home town, the ambition which drove them on to bigger, if not necessarily better, things, and why the music endures. It's an insightful interview which will interest not only admirers of 'the Minds', but music fans more generally as a picture emerges of a band unlike any other.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Best Films of 2021]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In a year when cinemas remain closed for the first few months, we did once again worry we wouldn't have that much to talk about when it came to the Best Films of 2021, and once again we were wrong. Because film found a way, with many memorable releases making it onto cinema screens as well as on the increasing variety of streaming services.</p>
<p>To celebrate that, and all things film, Chris Ward, Wesley Shearer, and Ali reunite for their annual chat about their favourite movies of the year.</p>
<p>Picking five each, they share their enthusiasm for films you may have missed first time around, and we’re sure you’ll find something to tickle your fancy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They talk about films during lockdown, this year’s Glasgow Film Festival, returning to cinemas (or not!), directors old and new, documentaries, new drama, musicals, the cinema vs home viewing, and a whole lot more.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest SWH! podcast Ali talks to one of Scots Whay Hae!'s favourite singer/songwriters, Annie Booth, to mark the release of her latest album 'Lazybody'. The two discuss how Annie feels to have a new record out, how it came to be, the differences between playing in a band and working solo, working with producer/musician Chris McCrory, the importance of collaboration, the exciting current state of Scottish music, and a whole lot more. The two also talk about putting yourself in front of other people (both on record and live), and the importance of perspective. Altogether it's an honest and insightful conversation which will ring true with many who want to create, but find some aspects of being an artist challenging.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest SWH! podcast Ali spoke to writer and poet Charlie Roy about her debut novel 'THE BROKEN PANE', which we consider one of the books of the year so far. The two discuss why this was the story Charlie wanted to tell, how the structure of the novel developed, her close relationship with, and the duty of care she felt for, her central character 'Tam', the importance of redrafting, creating believable and memorable secondary characters, and the complex nature of family secrets.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Charlie also talks about the themes of mental health, women's lives, and family, and why they are important to all her work, as well as explaining the central role her dog played in the writing of 'THE BROKEN PANE'. It's an interview which offers real insight into the life of a writer and what writing a novel entails.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[George Paterson - The Girl, The Crow, The Writer And The Fighter]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest SWH! podcast Ali spoke to writer George Paterson about his debut novel 'The Girl, The Crow, The Writer And The Fighter', available on 21st October 2021 - published by Into Books. The two discuss what inspired George to write this novel, the influence of all things American, specific influences, American literature, the importance of film with regard to the way the book was written, and much more.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The conversation also touches upon research, working with the Into Creative team, and the way that books can change lives. 'The Girl, The Crow, The Writer And The Fighter' is a great debut, one which we consider "Possibly the finest American novel not to come out of America", and it was a pleasure to discuss the themes and ideas behind it. If you're looking for your next read, this not only could, but should, be it.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest SWH! podcast Ali caught up with writer Iain Maloney (live from Japan!), and Angela and Paul Docherty from his publishers Liminal Ink. The main reason is to talk about Iain's new novella 'Life is Elsewhere/Burn Your Flags', a terrific, timeless, treatise on what happens when love dies, set against the specific backdrop of COVID. However, the conversation also covers the relationship between writer and publisher, the steep learning curve for new publishers, why the three wanted to work together, and so much more. We consider it a must-listen for readers, writers, and others interested in the world of books and publishing.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Graeme Macrae Burnet - Case Study]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest SWH! podcast Ali spoke to writer, and returning guest, Graeme Macrae Burnet about his latest novel 'Case Study' (published by Saraband). As with all of Graeme's books there's a lot to discuss, and the conversation turns to the life and work of R.D. Laing, the importance of research, the structure of the novel, how Graeme approaches writing, the excitement of writing a controversial character, the common threads which run though his fiction, the appeal of the cultural movements of the 1960s, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>They also discuss the cult of the author and the affect that has on the way books are marketed and received, and perhaps on the reader as well. It's always great to have Graeme on the podcast, and it was such a pleasure to be able to catch up with him in real life. The result is an insightful and entertaining interview which will give you a taste of what is undoubtedly one of the best books of the year.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Oliver Cook & Calum McClure - The Scottish Gallery]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest podcast Ali speaks to sculptor Oliver Cook and painter Calum McClure about their exhibitions at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh (2nd-25th September).</p>
<p>'Exploring the relationship between light and movement and the translucent properties of alabaster through sculptural forms and everyday objects, Oliver Cook’s work challenges the viewer to reconsider their preconceptions of sculpture’s fixed nature.'</p>
<p>'Calum McClure has had five successful exhibitions with The Scottish Gallery and was an invited artist at the Annual Exhibition of the Royal Academy in London in 2012. McClure is a painter who immerses himself in the landscape, evoking different atmospheres, through the representation of light, shadow and reflections.'</p>
<p>Two for the price of one, when taken together the podcast offers real insight into the work and inspirations of two artists who ask us to look at the world with fresh perspectives, and reconsider our relationships with it.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Exposure - Kirsty Law]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For our first video podcast (or vodcast, as no one is calling it) in some time, SWH! made a welcome trip Doon the Watter to Dunoon Burgh Hall to talk to previous podcast guest Kirsty Law about 'Exposure' - an exhibition which is a result of a collaboration between Gilles Perring and Andy Metcalf. Focusing on the two artists' relationship with the Isle of Jura, 'Exposure' is a multi-media production it features music, painting, poetry, photography, sound sculpture, installation, and film.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Produced by Kirsty's multi-disciplinary production company and artist support service, Helm Arts, it's a thought-provoking and emotionally exciting exhibition which stimulates the senses as you lose yourself in Perring and Metcalf's Jura. Ali talks to Kirsty about how the project began, the differing, almost opposing, perspectives on the subject, each aspect of the final show, the plans for taking 'Exposure' around the country, her own role in proceedings, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As the arts begin to open up again it's a fascinating insight into what goes on behind the scenes of such an exhibition, and is a reminder as to how much the arts need an audience, and how the two have missed each other.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Roberto Cassani]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the latest podcast Ali spoke to musician Roberto Cassani about his sensational album 'Ansema We Stand', his incredible life in music, and how he came to settle in rural Perthshire.

			<title><![CDATA[Best Books of 2020 (Part II)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This year was such a great one for Scottish writing that we had to split our Best Books of 2020 podcast into two parts to allow time for everything we had to talk about in. For both parts Ali was once again joined by Publishing Scotland's Vikki Reilly, who became a published author herself this year. The two pick their favourite books from the last 12 months, and take many detours and diversions along the way. We hope you find something of interest in their chat. Part I is already available at scotswhayhae.com.

			<title><![CDATA[Angela Hughes and Paul Docherty]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali spoke to writer Angela Hughes and her husband Paul about her memoir 'My Heart's Content: A Journey to Transplant'. Angela sets out not only why she wrote the book, but how it came to publication and the vital role that Paul, and their family and friends, play in the story. A searingly honest read, it is as much about love, and hope, as it is about Angela's specific journey, and, as a result, it is perhaps the most timely publication of recent years.

			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali caught up with writer and presenter Damian Barr to talk all about the second series of The Big Scottish Book Club which airs on BBC Scotland this Sunday (25th). It's a welcome return to one of the all too few TV shows which unashamedly celebrates and discusses all aspects of the book world and those who love it, and it's great to get such an informed and personal insight into the show, and hear who Damian has lined up to appear this time round. If you love books, and I know you do, then this podcast, like The Big Scottish Book Club itself, is an absolute must.

			<title><![CDATA[Jenny Sturgeon]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest SWH! Podcast Ali spoke to Jenny Sturgeon about her latest project 'The Living Mountain', which is not only the name of her new album but her series of podcasts, and the audio/visual live show which she hopes to tour, all of which are inspired by, and infused with the spirit of, Nan Shepherd's wonderful novella of the same name. Jenny Sturgeon is among SWH!'s favourite musicians - one steeped in the folk tradition as in evidence not only in her solo work, but also as a member of Salt House and Northern Flyway, and it was a real treat to talk to her about her work, and how she views the relationship between nature and art.

			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali spoke to artist and broadcaster Lachlan Goudie about his forthcoming exhibition 'Once Upon A Time', which is at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh, Oct - Nov 2020. Lachlan explains the thoughts behind the show, and why his original plans had to be scrapped. 'Once Upon A Time' is partly inspired by reading fairy tales to his daughter, and he discusses the importance of the imagination (especially in periods of isolation) and the enduring influence of the supernatural in Scottish art. The two also discuss Lachlan's superb and comprehensive book 'The Story of Scottish Art' which will have its launch at the Gallery on 16th November. It's an engaging and enlightening conversation with a man who is at the very centre of Scottish Art.

			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali was joined by writer and journalist Peter Ross to talk about his latest book 'A Tomb With A View'. It was the first one recorded face-to-face since Lockdown began (maintaining the required distance, of course) and it was a real pleasure to be able to chat to Peter in person. If you want to know about the book you'll have listen to the pod, but suffice to say it's a lovely conversation on a subject which touches upon us all.

			<itunes:summary>For the latest podcast Ali was joined by writer and journalist Peter Ross to talk about his latest book &apos;A Tomb With A View&apos;. It was the first one recorded face-to-face since Lockdown began (maintaining the required distance, of course) and it was a real pleasure to be able to chat to Peter in person. If you want to know about the book you&apos;ll have listen to the pod, but suffice to say it&apos;s a lovely conversation on a subject which touches upon us all.

			<title><![CDATA[John Scott]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali spoke to writer John Scott about his memoir 'To The Woods: A Journey Along The Appalachian Trail', which could be described as 'Zen and the Art of Trail Walking' such is the thought and detail involved. John's long walk was 20 years ago, and he reflects on the reasons for taking time out to undertake such a challenge, his complex love/hate affair with the USA, the characters and challenges he met along the way, and how he views his journey 20 years on. Talking to John was as interesting and inspirational as the book itself, and it proves once again that truth can be stranger than fiction.

			<title><![CDATA[Kirstin Innes]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali spoke to writer Kirstin Innes about her latest novel 'Scabby Queen'. The two discuss the origins of the title and why it fits with the structure of the book, where the initial idea came from, the importance of close-editing in a non-linear narrative, and how the central character of Clio Campbell drives events despite being absent for much of the book. Kirstin also talks about her experience of publishing a novel while Covid19 plays out, and how it has been received. 'Scabby Queen' is destined to be one of the most talked about novels of 2020 and it's fascinating to hear about it from the perspective of the author.

			<title><![CDATA[Mandy Haggith]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali spoke to author, poet, and academic Mandy Haggith about 'The Lyre Dancers', the third and final novel of the Stone Stories Trilogy, which was recently published with Saraband Books. Mandy talks about the historical origins of the trilogy, the incredible story of Pytheas, what inspired the books, why they were always going to be set in the Iron Age, and the importance of character. The two also discuss the themes across all three novels and their relevance to the present day, and why, if you want to get a different perspective of the land, you should get on the water. It's an utterly fascinating conversation about one of the most gripping series of recent times and we hope you enjoy listening to it as much as we did recording it.

			<title><![CDATA[Joe Donnelly]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast we spoke to journalist and writer Joe Donnelly about his book 'Checkpoint: How Video Games Power Up Minds, Kick Ass, and Save Lives'.

			<title><![CDATA[John Burns - Aleister Crowley]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest SWH! podcast we welcome back writer, storyteller, and mountaineer John Burns who was a guest previously when he talked about his novel 'Sky Dance' as well as his fascinating life. During that chat he mentioned his one-man show about infamous occultist Aleister Crowley, and we thought we had to talk to him again to learn more about this controversial historical figure. If you thought you knew about Crowley, then this may change your mind. If you have no idea who he is, prepare to be intrigued.

			<title><![CDATA[The Braidwood Brothers II - The 90s]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest SWH! podcast the Braidwood brothers got back together following their previous chat about their favourite Scottish records of the 1980s to talk about what they were listening to in the 90s. Once again they pick 10 records from the decade and discuss what they mean to them, and why. With one in Aberdeen for much of that time, and the other in Glasgow, it's interesting to learn how their listening habits were influenced by where they lived, and what they were up to.

			<title><![CDATA[Alan Parks]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest SWH! podcast Ali spoke to writer Alan Parks about his latest Harry McCoy thriller, Bobby March Will Live Forever. The two discuss the world of Harry McCoy and those who share it, the importance of returning characters, why he set the novels in 1970s Glasgow, the city's complex relationship with crime and its criminals, the inspirations for Bobby March, and why he is unlikely to write a novel based in the music business.

					The Harry McCoy novels are among the most exciting of recent times, and it's fascinating to get an insight into the influences and ideas behind them. With a fourth on the way, and hopefully many more to follow, Alan Parks is set to deliver a crime series which will stand the test of time.

			<title><![CDATA[The Braidwood Brothers]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Please forgive the indulgence, but for our first podcast using Zoom Ali caught up with Braemar Gallery owner and gig-promoter Andy Braidwood, who just happens to be his brother. The primary reason was to see if this worked as a way to podcast, but also for the two to catch up and talk about the most influential Scottish music of their formative years. Each pick ten albums or EPs from before 1990 which mean something important to them, and they discuss who, what, when, and why. We hope it's as enjoyable for you to listen to as it clearly was for the brothers to record. If nothing else it proves we can continue with the SWH! podcasts in these peculiar times.

The two were on to discuss their latest album Skinny Tricks, which is out on Scottish Fiction on the 15th May. With bassist Kris unfortunately sidelined, the brothers talked about the themes and inspirations behind the album, the dangers of unexpected national radio play, the collaborative nature of how they work, the changes witnessed over 10 years releasing music, the importance of albums having a strong individual identity, how they manage to sound different on each record yet still undeniably like themselves, and so, so, much more. It's a fascinating insight into the band and the making of what we're saying is destined to be a classic.

			<title><![CDATA[Carina Birrell - Harry Birrell Presents Films of Love and War]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest SWH! podcast Ali spoke to actor and producer Carina Birrell all about 'Harry Birrell Presents Films of Love & War' ahead of its broadcast on BBC Scotland on 17th March. The film was a labour of love for Carina as Harry is her grandfather, and the film centres on his astonishing film footage and diaries.

					The conversation touches on how the film came to be, Harry's love of film and his amazing life, his time in and out of the army, the important role of director Matt Pinder, how actor Richard Madden became involved, what it means to Carina that it has made it onto screens, and the amazing synchronicity that seems to be attached to the film.

					It's a poignant and heart-warming half hour that gives insight and context to what is an incredible documentary of the 20th century through one man's eyes.

			<title><![CDATA[This World Won't Break - Glasgow Film Festival]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest in our series of Glasgow Film Festival 2020 podcasts Ali spoke to director Josh David Jordan, actor & producer Jessica Marie Jordan, and actor & musician Greg Schroeder about their film 'This World Won't Break'. As you'll hear, this is an incredibly personal film for all of those involved, and they explain why this is, why no-one but Greg was going to play the central character of Wes, discuss the complex relationship between fathers and sons, the problem of loneliness, the marriage of blues and booze, how place and space play an important part in the film, the way in which the music is a character in its own right, and so much more. You get the feeling that the sublime 'This World Won't Break' could not, and would not, have been made by any other group of people, and this shared vision is as clear in our conversation as it is in the film itself, about which you can find more at https://www.thisworldwontbreak.com/

			<itunes:summary>For the latest in our series of Glasgow Film Festival 2020 podcasts Ali spoke to director Josh David Jordan, actor &amp; producer Jessica Marie Jordan, and actor &amp; musician Greg Schroeder about their film &apos;This World Won&apos;t Break&apos;. As you&apos;ll hear, this is an incredibly personal film for all of those involved, and they explain why this is, why no-one but Greg was going to play the central character of Wes, discuss the complex relationship between fathers and sons, the problem of loneliness, the marriage of blues and booze, how place and space play an important part in the film, the way in which the music is a character in its own right, and so much more. You get the feeling that the sublime &apos;This World Won&apos;t Break&apos; could not, and would not, have been made by any other group of people, and this shared vision is as clear in our conversation as it is in the film itself, about which you can find more at https://www.thisworldwontbreak.com/

			<title><![CDATA[Scott Graham - Run - Glasgow Film Festival]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest in our series of Glasgow Film Festival podcasts, Ali spoke to director Scott Graham, about his latest feature 'Run', which follows on from the success of previous films 'Shell' and 'Iona' and which shares some of their themes. Graham talks about those themes, as well as what inspired 'Run', the influence of the music of Bruce Springsteen, the challenges of family life, the escape of joy-riding, the practicalities of filming in and out of cars, and the peculiar dynamics of small towns. 'Run' is an exceptional film, with memorable performances from all, and it is fascinating to hear the thoughts of the director now the film is being shown to audiences. It is a conversation which lends the film itself further dimensions.

			<title><![CDATA[Peter Mackie Burns - Rialto - Glasgow Film Festival]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest of SWH!'s Glasgow Film Festival 2020 podcasts Ali spoke to a previous guest, director Peter Mackie Burns, who told us all about his latest feature 'Rialto', which will be at the festival on 27th Feb (with a Q&A) and, if you miss that, on the afternoon of the 28th. Peter explains the story of the film's title, why it's set in Dublin, the themes and thoughts behind the film, the importance of 'Rialto's' score, and just what, and who, drew him to the project in the first place. It's always a pleasure to catch up with Peter, and this was no exception as he gives a fascinating insight into his film making process, and a whole lot more.

This is a show which "asks audiences to consider how relationships (or lack of) with our fathers affect us, and, to reflect on the imprints they leave behind", and Leyla discusses the origins of the show, the vital role her mum plays, the challenges of an Edinburgh run, the details of drag, how theatre differs from her spoken word, the importance of the latter in her life, story-telling, and loads more.

			<title><![CDATA[Scottish Opera Podcast #10 - General Director Alex Reedijk]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest of our podcasts in collaboration with Scottish Opera we spoke to the company's General Director Alex Reedijk, and it proved to be a fascinating conversation - one which adds extra context to the other podcasts in the series. Alex talks about how he came to the role, what makes it so special, the challenges faced when he joined 14 years ago, the four central strands that run through the company's ethos, and what he is most proud of from his time with Scottish Opera. It's a must listen, not only for opera fans and followers, but for anyone involved in the arts as Alex gives a rare insight into what is involved in the organisation and running of such a prestigious company.

What unfolded was a warm, fun, and fascinating chat about this year's programme, the challenges of programming a festival, the GFF ethos, the multiple strands, how the festival has grown, and some memories of past galas and glories. It's a lovely conversation with two film-lovers, who are clearly great friends, and who believe they have their ideal jobs. Talking to them, and considering festivals past as well as the amazing programme for 2020, we would have to agree.

This time around they are looking at the best films of the year, and Ali's role becomes more host rather than participant as his own movie going has been admittedly lacking this year. Luckily the other three more than make up for it as they talk about the best Scottish films, their personal favourites, and pick their best film of the decade. Listen in and see if you agree.

As well as discussing in detail their personal favourites, they look at the writers who have left their mark, awards and award winners, festivals old and new, the healthy state of Scottish poetry, what's happening in the publishing world, the prevailing trends and themes of 2019, what to look forward to in 2020, and a whole lot more. It's always one of the most pleasant podcasts to record as the two geek out on their love of books, and we hope you enjoy listening as much as we did recording it.

			<itunes:summary>For our Best Books of 2019 podcast Ali was once again joined by Publishing Scotland&apos;s Vikki Reilly to discuss their year in books. As well as discussing in detail their personal favourites, they look at the writers who have left their mark, awards and award winners, festivals old and new, the healthy state of Scottish poetry, what&apos;s happening in the publishing world, the prevailing trends and themes of 2019, what to look forward to in 2020, and a whole lot more. It&apos;s always one of the most pleasant podcasts to record as the two geek out on their love of books, and we hope you enjoy listening as much as we did recording it.

			<title><![CDATA[John D Burns]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali was back in Edinburgh to talk to mountaineer, storyteller, and writer, John D. Burns, and the story he has to tell is a fascinating one. He talks about how he first discovered the delights of hillwalking in the Lake District in his youth, his thoughts on how we should treat, view, and interact with nature, why he fell out and then back in love with the hills, the politics of the wild, his forays into poetry and stand-up, and so much more. It's one of the most interesting and informative podcasts yet, and I know you'll come away with a new view on our landscape, and on life.

			<title><![CDATA[Scottish Opera Podcast #8 - Music Librarian Gordon Grant]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest in our series of podcasts in conjunction with Scottish Opera SWH! spoke to Gordon Grant, the company's Music Librarian. What unfolds is a fascinating insight into a role which few consider when they think of opera but which, as you will hear, is a vital one. Crucially involved in productions from the very beginning to the final curtain fall, Gordon explains what the role entails, how he came to it, the importance of close collaboration, and what are the challenges and constrictions when it comes to the musical score. As well as being SO's librarian Gordon is also in charge of their supertitles, the written translations and text which have become an important part of opera and he explains the technicalities faced. Overall it's an engrossing conversation which looks in detail at an individual role but which will give you a greater insight into Scottish Opera as a whole.

			<title><![CDATA[Jemma Neville]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest SWH! podcast Ali headed to Edinburgh to chat to writer Jemma Neville all about 'Constitution Street: finding hope in an age of anxiety' (published by 404 Ink), her fascinating and inspirational book which SWH! described as, "a socio-political work with humanity at its heart, and a timely reminder that there is more that unites than divides us." Talking in the welcoming surroundings of The Hideout Cafe on the very street itself the two discuss the ethos behind the book, the way it is structured, and how both are reflected and inspired by the place and the people who live and work there as well, as well as the way that the issues and themes of 'Constitution Street' relate to communities of all sizes, and a whole lot more. You'll never look at your own locale in the same way again.

			<title><![CDATA[Scottish Opera Podcast #6 - Staff Director Roxana Haines]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For number 6 in our series of podcasts in conjunction with Scottish Opera Ali spoke to Staff Director, Roxana Haines. It's a fascinating and informative discussion with someone whose job brings her into contact and collaboration with most areas of the company. She explains her journey to the role, her training in theatre and the specific demands of opera, her role in terms of productions and the challenges that different ones bring, with particular reference to the current 'Opera Highlights Tour' and the opera for young children 'Fox-tot!', and a lot more. Through it all Roxana's enthusiasm and love for what she does shines through, and we hope you enjoy listening to the conversation as much as we did recording it.

			<title><![CDATA[Richy Muirhead - SAMAS]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali caught up with Richy Muirhead, the founder and creative director of the Scottish Alternative Music Awards (SAMAS) which is celebrating its 10th year. It's a fascinating chat which covers the origins and history of the awards, an explanation of the criteria, the categories, this year's nominees, notable previous winners, the importance of the live show (this year on October 25th, St Luke's, Glasgow), and lots more. There are also 5 tracks from some of last year's winners, including Declan West and the Decadent West (Rock/Alternative), Lylo (Live Act), The Dunts (Newcomer), Solareye (Hip Hop), and Megan Airlie (Acoustic). Ali also offers the point of view from a SAMAs nominator, so hopefully you'll end up with a better understanding not only of how these awards work, but the aims and ideology behind them.

If you have ever been to a Scottish Opera performance, no matter the scale of the production, you'll know what an integral, important, and creative part the props department have to play. Marian discusses her approach to the role, the collaboration with other departments, the joy in creating memorable moments, the demands of different productions, the practicalities and problem solving involved, and the culture of prop making in Scotland and beyond.

			<title><![CDATA[Scottish Opera Podcast #4 - Director of Education & Outreach Jane Davidson]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the fourth of our series of podcasts with members of Scottish Opera we spoke to Jane Davidson, their Director of Education & Outreach. She explains what the job entails, the company's education strategy, their partnerships at home and abroad, the challenges faced in the role, how they reach out to all areas of Scotland, and work with all ages groups. It's a fascinating insight into the work Scottish Opera does off stage and often away from the public eye. As the conversation unfolds you are left in no doubt of the love that Jane has for her job, and how passionately she believes that art and performance have a vital role to play in a nation's education. And so say all of us!

			<title><![CDATA[Half Formed Things]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali headed through to Edinburgh to talk to Edwin and Morgan, two members of Half Formed Things (unapologetically one of SWH!'s favourite bands, as you'll quickly be able to tell). They talk about their album 'To Live In The Flicker', the origins of the band, what it's like to work with such close friends and family, the importance or otherwise of place, their shared philosophy, themes, influences, and a whole lot more. You'll also get two tracks from the album which will give you a clear idea as to just how good it is. And if the other two members of the band, Nici and Matthew, disagree with any of it Ali is more than willing to record a follow up to give their side of the story.

			<title><![CDATA[Ringwood Publishing]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest SWH! podcast Ali spoke to Chief Executive of Ringwood Publishing Sandy Jamieson, one of their authors Dr Anne Pettigrew, and their Assistant Managing Director Laure Camail. Celebrating their 20th birthday this year, Glasgow's Ringwood show that it is possible to publish and survive in a city which has notoriously had problems sustaining and maintaining a publishing culture in recent years. The discussion touches on the reasons for starting Ringwood, their co-operative business model and how that has evolved, Anne's novel 'No The Life Imagined' and the publishing process from the writer's point of view, how Ringwood has had to adapt the changes in the marketplace, and their plans for the future. It's a must listen for anyone interested in publishing as they talk about many aspects of the process and the industry, both positive and negative.

If you haven't heard of Maclean then this is a perfect place to start, and if you do then I'm sure you'll learn something new about the man dubbed both "Hero of Red Clydeside" and "the most dangerous man in Britain" depending on which newspaper you read.

			<title><![CDATA[Jonathon Swinard]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali headed to the home of Scottish Opera in central Glasgow to talk to Jonathon Swinard, the new Artistic Director of the Scottish Opera Young Company (SOYC). Over the years Scots Whay Hae! has reviewed many of Scottish Opera's productions so it was a pleasure to talk to someone at the heart of the company, especially one whose concentration is on youth and the talent of tomorrow. The two discuss the aims of SOYC and Jonathon's role in achieving those, overcoming preconceptions, and how Scottish Opera is managing to reach out to all ages and areas in Scotland. It's a rare and fascinating insight into one of Scotland's cultural institutions which we hope will encourage you to give Opera a try if you haven't already.

			<title><![CDATA[Scotch: The Golden Dram - Andrew Peat]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast, a Glasgow Film Festival special, Ali met up with film-director Andrew Peat at the city's CCA to talk about his documentary 'Scotch: The Golden Dram'. Andrew has roots in the city and he was delighted to be bringing his film "home" as he put it. 'Scotch' is a film which follows the making of whisky from "grain to glass", and Andrew talks about how he presents that journey, the characters he met along the way, the emotional connection between the drink and the country, and the financial one. The film is for everyone, whether you are interested in whisky or not, and we'd like to think the podcast is the same. In the meantime, your health!

			<title><![CDATA[L-Space]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali spoke to Lily, Gordon and Dickson from L-space who are, as regular readers of SWH! will know, one of our favourite bands. Their album, 'Kipple Arcadia' (LNFG) was one of the best in recent years and no discerning home should be without it. The talk turns to expectation versus reality, how their sound and songwriting developed, the thinking behind the themes explored in the music, and what the future may hold, bit just for the band but for all of us. The sign of a good podcast is that time flies, either when recording or listening, and if this theory holds up then you are in for a treat. The pod opens with their song 'Home Sweet Home' and closes the exclusive play of two new tracks, 'Moving Traffic Overhead' and 'Waking Up Bathed In The Light Of Things You Can't Afford'. A podcast not to miss.

			<itunes:summary>For the latest podcast Ali spoke to Lily, Gordon and Dickson from L-space who are, as regular readers of SWH! will know, one of our favourite bands. Their album, &apos;Kipple Arcadia&apos; (LNFG) was one of the best in recent years and no discerning home should be without it. The talk turns to expectation versus reality, how their sound and songwriting developed, the thinking behind the themes explored in the music, and what the future may hold, bit just for the band but for all of us. The sign of a good podcast is that time flies, either when recording or listening, and if this theory holds up then you are in for a treat. The pod opens with their song &apos;Home Sweet Home&apos; and closes the exclusive play of two new tracks, &apos;Moving Traffic Overhead&apos; and &apos;Waking Up Bathed In The Light Of Things You Can&apos;t Afford&apos;. A podcast not to miss.

			<title><![CDATA[David Keenan - For The Good Times]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali spoke to writer David Keenan about his latest novel 'For The Good Times'. After the success of his previous book 'This Is Memorial Device', (Scots Whay Hae!'s Book of 2017), it was always going to be fascinating to see how he would follow it, but he has done so in fine style. The two discuss why it is set in Belfast in the '70s, the personal connections Keenan has to that time and place, the themes which he addresses, as well as magic, masculinity, Irish Modernism, and a whole lot more. It was a pleasure to once again spend time in Keenan's company as there are few writers who talk with the insight, honesty, and passion about their work as he does. This is a podcast not to be missed.

			<title><![CDATA[Beerjacket]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali caught up with Peter Kelly, better known as singer/songwriter Beerjacket, to talk about 'Silver Cords' which is not only the name of his latest collection of songs, but also of the accompanying book of short stories, (a review of which you can read over at Scots Whay Hae!). The two talk about the project from its early days through to completion, how the stories work with the songs, the reason Peter chooses to work under a pseudonym, and why Beerjacket is now back after some time away. It's a conversation which will appeal to anyone interested in the artistic process, whether making music or writing, and just how important collaboration is.

			<description><![CDATA[For our review of the year in film Ali & Ian were joined once more by Chris Ward and Wesley Shearer to discuss their favourite film of 2018, the year in Scottish film, any themes and trends which could be uncovered, and if Mel Gibson films are better or worse for the involvement of Mel Gibson. It's an enjoyable hour where all three have some shared choices, and some which are new to everyone else, and possibly to you.

The two talk about the history of his LP Record store, the move into becoming a label, (releasing music from Wesley A.

There are also tales of Nicki Minaj, the vital role of darts in the LP story, time spent in Texas and Seattle, the pros and cons of the vinyl resurrection, and his vision of the perfect radio station.

Murray to talk about this novel 'As The Women Lay Dreaming' which examines the Iolaire disaster of 1919 and why the story of one of the worst peacetime maritime disasters remains largely unknown outside of the Highlands & Islands. The two discuss the impact this terrible event has had on a community through the generations, and also the main themes of the novel which include language, religion, class, art, guilt, and family. It's an utterly fascinating conversation about one of Scotland's defining moments in history. With the centenary of the sinking of the Iolaire imminent this is a podcast you won't want to miss.

If you haven't heard of or read Chris' work, where have you been? His previous book, 'Hings' took the world of Scottish writing by storm announcing a fresh and exciting new voice. 'HWFG', ('Here We Fucking Go', if you haven't worked it out yet), sees him build on the success of 'Hings' introducing readers to new characters as well as bringing back fan favourites. It was fascinating to hear what inspired Chris to write, his influences, the difficulty in following a hit, the highs and lows of being reviewed, and his plans to branch out from writing fiction. He also kindly reads one of his stories which gives the uninitiated a great introduction to Chris McQueer and his work.

Easton to talk about her new album 'Impossible Stuff', which is released on the 5th October on Olive Grove Records. As well as explaining the Canadian roots of the record Carla talks about the importance of home, her many collaborations, her musical history, Teen Canteen, and the documentary she is working on with Blair Young about women pioneers of Scottish pop. Carla is one of the most innovative and interesting musicians working today and it was great talking to her. If you love music you just have to take a listen, but it's also a fascinating insight as to what is involved in the artistic process.

Carla is one of the most innovative and interesting musicians working today and it was great talking to her. If you love music you just have to take a listen, but it&apos;s also a fascinating insight as to what is involved in the artistic process.

			<title><![CDATA[May Miles Thomas]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali spoke to writer & director May Miles Thomas about her incredible film 'Voyageuse' and the issues and themes it addresses such as family, ageing, grief, and much more. However, the two also discuss different approaches to making film, May's previous projects, using setbacks as inspiration, the problem in getting heard in a crowded market, and the primary importance of story in her work. It's a fantastic listen which will be of interest to anyone who is interested, not only in the process and reality of filmmaking, but in all aspects of creating art in Scotland. There is also mention of Hitler, satanism in Glasgow, and the CIA. What more could you want from a podcast?

			<title><![CDATA[Andy Davidson]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali met up with the American novelist Andy Davidson before his event at The Edinburgh International Book Festival. In an ironically dreich Charlotte Square the two discuss Andy's terrific debut novel 'In The Valley Of The Sun' which is out now on the Contraband imprint of Saraband books, and which is one of the best of the year so far. It's a fascinating chat about influences and ideas, genre fiction vs literary fiction, horror writers and films, the importance of character, and why, in terms of writing, there really is no place like home. They also talk about the differences in publishing in the US as opposed to the UK. For anyone with an interest in writing, or reading, it's a must listen.

			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali visited Dundee to talk about all things artistic and cultural in relation to that great city. To do so he was joined by the co-founding director of Creative Dundee Gillian Easson, the writer and playwrite (and long term supporter of SWH!) Anna Stewart, and the TV and theatre actor, (currently on the brilliant 'The Terror' on AMC) Gordon Morris. All three are proud Dundonians and have a long and vibrant connection with the city's culture. They talk about the past, present, and their future hopes for the city and its artistic community, examining how it has become an internationally renowned centre for the arts while remaining determinedly committed to engaging with its citizens. It's a fascinating discussion which gives a great overview of a place, its people, and its culture.

			<title><![CDATA[Colin McIlroy]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In the latest podcast we look at the life and work of Muriel Spark with our guest Dr Colin McIlroy who is the Muriel Spark Project Curator at the National Library of Scotland, and who was instrumental in their recent The International Style of Muriel Spark Exhibition. This year is the centenary of the birth of Spark, and the exhibition was just part of the #MurielSpark100 celebrations which are ongoing throughout 2018. Colin tells us all about the exhibition, before he and Ali talk about the novels, Spark's life, her other writing, and so much more. If you are a newcomer to Muriel Spark, or think that she begins and ends with The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie, this is the perfect podcast to persuade you to investigate further. If you are already a fan, then you're bound to find something new to you.

			<description><![CDATA[For the lastest podcast, Ali spoke to Aye Write! Book Festival programmer, Bob McDevitt in Glasgow's CCA (which explains the background 'atmosphere'). They discuss the history of the festival, what to expect this year, Bob's personal highlights, the challenges of festival programming, his similar role for Bloody Scotland and the Pitlochry Winter Words Festival, and much, much more. There is  also mention of 'Men In Kilts'.  As a precursor to Aye Write! 2018 it's the perfect listen, especially when married to the SWH! preview which is over at the website right now. SWH! is delighted to be involved in some of this year's events, so hopefully see you there.

Over a glass of wine, the two discuss Rachel's book, their first memories of whisky, the perception of the drink at home and abroad, the mythology which has grown around it, and how it relates to Scotland, and a whole lot more. Put simply, she separates the truth from the fiction, and there is plenty of both when it comes to our original national drink.

For the first two, Ali and Ian were once again joined by irregular podcast guest and resident film expert Chris Ward, and Scottish music man manager Wesley Shearer. In this, Part I, we concentrate on the films of 2017, and give you some recommendations. As usual, Ali kicks things off talking about his favourite Scottish films of the year, including T2: Trainspotting, Daphne, Benny, The End Of The Game, Lost In France before Chris and Wesley widen the discussion out to talk about the best films they have seen in the last 12 months.

			<title><![CDATA[Peter Ross - Harry Bingo]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[On the latest podcast Ali spoke to journalist Peter Ross about the follow up to his 2014 book, 'Daunderlust: Dispatches From Unreported Scotland', 'The Passion Of Harry Bingo: Further Dispatches From Unreported Scotland'. Peter goes into some of the dispatches in detail as the two discuss how Scottish football may be a microcosm of Scottish life, the importance of tradition, how to be accepted in as diverse places as a grouse shoot and a sex shop, and so much more. Even then they only touch upon a handful of the stories told, so if you want to know the rest you're going to have to read the book.

			<title><![CDATA[Louise Welsh - No Dominion]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The latest podcast is an interview with one of our favourite guests, the writer Louise Welsh. Her latest novel, 'No Dominion', is the final part in her Plague Times Trilogy which began back in 2014 (not five years ago as Ali suggests) with 'A Lovely Way To Burn', and continued with 'Death Is A Welcome Guest'. The conversation touches on the central themes in the trilogy which include family, morality, society, and what could happen in the face of a global pandemic threat. Just the usual. There is also talk of ghost stories and opera. What more do you want from a podcast?

David Simons, initially about his latest novel 'A Woman Of Integrity' but also his 'Glasgow To Galilee' trilogy and one of Ali's favourite novels, 'An Exquisite Sense Of What Is Beautiful'.

			<title><![CDATA[Andrew Greig]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast, Ali headed to Edinburgh to talk to poet, writer and musician, Andrew Greig. The first topic of conversation is 'Clean By Rain', the CD of spoken word and music Andrew has recorded with musician Brian Michie. As you'll hear, music has played a large part in Andrew's life, and this latest project (& his next) provide a wonderful symmetry to his life so far. The two also talk about his poetry and prose, particularly 'Fair Helen', which prompts a musical interlude. It was an absolute pleasure talking to Andrew, and we hope you have similar feelings listening to him.

			<title><![CDATA[Alasdair Gray and Kevin Brown]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The latest podcast is a fascinating conversation with two previous podcast guests, the writer and artists Alasdair Gray, and the driving force being Songs For Scotland, Kevin Brown. Kevin is curating an exhibition of Alasdair's art at London's Coningsby Gallery, and he tells us all about it, while Alasdair discusses what inspired him to illustrate his writing, his previous exhibitions, the importance of public art, and much more, including his latest project. As always, it's a pleasure to spend time in both men's company, and we hope you think the same.

			<title><![CDATA[Douglas Skelton]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In the latest podcast, Ali and Ian met up with writer Douglas Skelton to talk initially about his Dominic Queste novels, "The Dead Dont Boogie" and "Tag - You're Dead", but the discussion touches upon so much more. They talk about Douglas's Davie McCall series, his journalism and non-fiction, the importance of secondary characters, Glasgow's fascination with crime, the influence of Ed McBain, Shane, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and the greatest TV show of all time (TM), Hill Street Blues. It is a must hear for anyone with an interest in crime writing, but will also appeal to a much wider audience, just as Douglas Skelton's novels do.

It is a live recording of the launch of the book featuring readings and music. We were going to edit it but could not bring ourselves to leave any one or any song out, so this is the full director's cut. Enjoy.

			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ali spoke to writer David Keenan about his novel This Is Memorial Device. Anyone who has read the Scots Whay Hae! review of the book (on the website now) will know how highly we rate it, and it's fascinating to hear David talk about the influences behind it, why it was always going to be an Airdrie novel, the reasons the book is structured as it is, and so much more. We're calling it one of the most interesting and engaging podcasts yet, but listen for yourselves and see if that's a bold claim or not.

			<title><![CDATA[Lou McLoughlan]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The latest podcast is a timely one as Ali talks to director and cinematographer Lou McLoughlan in the week this year's Glasgow Film Festival begins (and there's a preview of that over at Scots Whay Hae!). Lou discusses her film '16 Years Till Summer', an astonishing documentary which was critically acclaimed by audiences and festival panels alike. She then discusses the pros and cons of documentary making in Scotland, and how the reception abroad can differ widely from that at home. It all makes for a fascinating listen for anyone interested in film.*Recorded in Glasgow's Project Cafe, there is quite a bit of background noise to being with and we hope that doesn't impede your enjoyment.

			<itunes:summary>The latest podcast is a timely one as Ali talks to director and cinematographer Lou McLoughlan in the week this year&apos;s Glasgow Film Festival begins (and there&apos;s a preview of that over at Scots Whay Hae!). Lou discusses her film &apos;16 Years Till Summer&apos;, an astonishing documentary which was critically acclaimed by audiences and festival panels alike. She then discusses the pros and cons of documentary making in Scotland, and how the reception abroad can differ widely from that at home. It all makes for a fascinating listen for anyone interested in film.*Recorded in Glasgow&apos;s Project Cafe, there is quite a bit of background noise to being with and we hope that doesn&apos;t impede your enjoyment.

			<title><![CDATA[Catherine Czerkawska - Burnscast 2017]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In our Burnscast for 2017, Ali and Ian travelled to the heart of Burns' country in Ayrshire to talk to the writer Catherine Czerkawska about her novel, 'The Jewel', which examines Burns relationship with his wife Jean Armour, from Jean's point of view. It is a story rarely told, and what follows is an hour of fascinating chat about Jean and Robert which focuses on the reality of family life rather than in the mythology which surrounded, and continues to attach itself to, Burns. There's also a little bit of poetry. It is Burns Night after all.

			<title><![CDATA[Last Night From Glasgow]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In our first podcast of 2017, Ali talks to Ian Smith and Murray Easton, two of the founding members of record label Last Night From Glasgow. In under a year they have released some of the best records of recent times, and have built up a loyal following in the process. Approaching the music business with new ideas, or old ideas presented in a new way, LNFG are a success story that shows no sign of slowing, and anyone with a love of music, or any other area of the arts, will find something of interest in their conversation. There's also some exclusive music to boot.

			<description><![CDATA[In this, Part II of our end of year podcast Ali, Chris and Wesley concentrate on the best music of 2016, both recorded and live. Even our sound-guru, Ian, chips in. It's been a cracking year for new music. As you may suspect, we start with the best in Scottish music before a wide-ranging discussion as to what has been on offer from elsewhere. In case you missed it, Part I looked back at film and books from the last 12 months, and you can still hear that now at http://bit.ly/2hnpEjD, as well as indulge yourself in our extensive back catalogue of over 70 podcasts at http://apple.co/2hCJaVw

			<description><![CDATA[For our end of year podcast, Ali and Ian were once again joined by regular pod guest and resident film expert, Chris Ward, and Scottish music man, Wesley Shearer. As we ran well over the two hour mark we've decided to split it into two parts. In Part I we concentrate on the films and books of 2016, and give you recommendations about the best of both. We also talk about the marketing of movies, the career of Isabelle Hupert, the importance of independent publishers, the welcome return of Alasdair Gray, and James Kelman at 70. We also name writer Graeme Macrae Burnet as our Man Of The Year.

			<description><![CDATA[In the latest podcast Ali and Ian are joined by musicians Ross and Alasdair Whyte who, under the moniker WHYTE, have collaborated on the excellent album “Fairich”. What is it like? You'll just have to listen to the podcast, which not only has the explanation from the horses' mouths, but also features an exclusive play of two tracks...at least we're claiming it as such.

Pauline's debut novel, 'Armadillos', is out now, and you can read the Scots Whay Hae! review on the website. It's an unforgettable book and the two discuss it at length, but also tough on writing courses, treading the boards and touring the world, and being part of a cultural phenomenon. Sounds like something that would interest you? Of course it does.

			<description><![CDATA[After a year off, the Scots Whay Hae! annual Burnscast returns in style with Ali and Ian joined by our very own Ronnie Young to talk all things Rabbie, particularly the Futurelearn on-line course, “Robert Burns: Poets, Songs & Legacy”, which is open to all, and is entirely free. You can hear all about it on the podcast, but further details can be found at https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/robert-burns/1 . They also talk about Burns the Icon, and how this Ayrshire poet became one of the most recognisable faces around the world. It’s the perfect accompaniment to Burns Night – but then, we would say that.

			<itunes:summary>After a year off, the Scots Whay Hae! annual Burnscast returns in style with Ali and Ian joined by our very own Ronnie Young to talk all things Rabbie, particularly the Futurelearn on-line course, “Robert Burns: Poets, Songs &amp; Legacy”, which is open to all, and is entirely free. You can hear all about it on the podcast, but further details can be found at https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/robert-burns/1 . They also talk about Burns the Icon, and how this Ayrshire poet became one of the most recognisable faces around the world. It’s the perfect accompaniment to Burns Night – but then, we would say that.

			<title><![CDATA[The Best of 2015]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For our “Best of 2015” podcast, Ian and Ali were joined by regular, Chris Ward, and Scottish music man, Wesley Shearer (manager for Campfires In Winter, Michael Cassidy and I Am David Laing) to talk about what floated their collective boats in the last 12 months. Add in the usual festive missive from friend of SWH!, Ronnie Young, and you end up with an epic podcast which approaches the 2 hour mark. But never mind the length, feel the quality.

			<title><![CDATA[Graham Lironi and Graeme Macrae Burnet]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In the latest podcast, Ali talks to writers Graham Lironi and Graeme Macrae Burnet about their latest novels (Oh Marina Girl and His Bloody Project respectively), both of which have been published on Saraband Books crime imprint, Contraband. They discuss crime fiction and subverting readers’ expectations, genre fiction and the problem with labels, the importance of editing, unreliable narration, the health or otherwise of the Scottish writing community, and what’s really important in the life of a writer. The hour or so just flew by, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we did recording it. We’re calling it "a must listen for anyone interested in writing and books”, and we wouldn’t lie about something like that.

			<description><![CDATA[In the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast, Ali talks to broadcaster, journalist and TV executive Stuart Cosgrove about his terrific new book Detroit 67: The Year That Changed Soul. As Stuart explains, it's so much more than a book on music, and what follows is a fascinating chat about how Detroit in 1967 influenced and reflected America and the times.

			<title><![CDATA[Doug Johnstone]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Ali was in Edinburgh for some Festival shenanigans but took time out to talk to SWH! favourite Doug Johnstone to talk about his new novel 'The Jump'. A difficult novel to discuss in terms of plot, the chat concentrates on the themes in the novel, family dramas, domestic noir, the best use of research and the importance of being honest. As a sort of bonus extra, Doug also gives his advice to all those who want to write, which alone makes this a must listen.

			<title><![CDATA[Stuart and Karn David]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In the latest Scots Whay Hae! podcast, Ian and Ali are joined by Stuart and Karn David. It's a timely chat as we discuss Stuart's recent book In The All-Night Cafe about the early days of Belle and Sebastian, as well as Looper's handsome 5 CD box-set, These Things, which has just been released. However, as usual we stray from topics to talk about such diverse things as the art of letter writing, musical influences and the problems that face the introverted artist. It’s 40 mins well spent in excellent company.

			<title><![CDATA[Ronnie Browne]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[For the latest podcast Ian and Ali headed east to talk to The Corries’ Ronnie Browne about his recently published autobiography. What unfolds is one of the most entertaining podcasts yet as Ronnie talks about his young life in Edinburgh, his career as an artist, the strength he gained from his family life, and, of course, his time as one of Scotland’s most iconic musicians. But, as Ronnie makes clear, this is his life story, not The Corries, and the resulting interview is moving, funny and informative. We hope you enjoy listening to it as much as we did recording it.

In the first, Ali talks to writer Zoe Strachan, who is wearing her editor’s hat as she talks about all things ‘Out There’, the anthology of LGBT writing which was published late last year, and which Scots Whay Hae! reviewed on the 18/01/15. Zoe goes into the influences and inspirations behind the book’s conception, and talks about the process of bringing so many writers together. The second half is made up of some terrific readings from ‘Out There’, which were recorded at the launch of LGBT history month at the Tron Theatre. Put the two together, and you have a podcast which informs as well as entertains, which is what we ideally aim for in these recordings.

With that in mind we’ve split into three more manageable sections with the usual SWH! guitar sting to signal a break. The reason for this length? Well, Ian, Chris and Ali hadn’t been together for a while, and had a lot of films, music and books to talk about. Add in the yearly Falkirk missive from Ronnie Young to kick things off, and what you end up with is a fairly comprehensive round up of the best things from 2014.

			<description><![CDATA[Scots Whay Hae! made the trip to Summerhall in Edinburgh to talk to writer, poet, playwright and polymath, Ron Butlin about his life and work. The result is just under an hour of informative and entertaining chat that is a must listen for anyone interested in writing. Of course, we would say that, but it doesn’t make it any less true. If you have never listened to a Scots Whay Hae! podcast before then we suggest this is the perfect place to start.

The result is just under an hour of informative and entertaining chat that is a must listen for anyone interested in writing. Of course, we would say that, but it doesn’t make it any less true. If you have never listened to a Scots Whay Hae! podcast before then we suggest this is the perfect place to start.

			<title><![CDATA[Olive Grove Records - Lloyd Meredith]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Ian and Ali have been trying to get Lloyd Meredith on the podcast for some time, and this month they get their man. As music blogger Peenko he was one of Scottish music’s greatest champions, and, alongside Halina Rifai, he founded Olive Grove Records, who are home to Jo Mango, Woodenbox, The Son(s), Call To Mind and more. He also manages Randolph’s Leap as well. All of the above are some of Scots Whay Hae!’s favourite bands and musicians, and what unfolds on the pod is basically one fanboy talking to another about Olive Grove and much more.

			<title><![CDATA[An interview with Alasdair Gray]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Back in the early summer Ali went to talk to Alasdair Gray about his love of reading and the importance of being carefully taught from an early age. The conversation formed the basis of an article for the NLS magazine, Discovery, and you can read the longer version at Scots Whay Hae! now. Ian couldn't be there to record, so apologies if the sound is a little erratic.

			<description><![CDATA[Ian and Ali made the picturesque trip to Braemar to talk to Alasdair Roberts and Ross Whyte about their collaborative project as musicians in residence. The chat takes place in one of Braemar’s churches where the two have been recording, and which lends a certain atmosphere to matters which you wouldn’t normally get in the Scots Whay Hae! kitchen. After an initial discussion about their time in Braemar, talk turns to the nature of collaboration, how to marry different styles of music, and how to convey a sense of place artistically.

			<title><![CDATA[SWH-2 #11: with James Robertson]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The latest podcast is a fascinating chat with author James Robertson who talks Scott, MacDiarmid and Hogg, the importance of recognising a native language to any culture and learning lessons from history, as well as talking us through all of his own work. May I humbly suggest that if you only listen to one Scots Whay Hae! podcast, this is the one to choose. It's certainly the most interesting afternoon Ali and Ian have spent in some time.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>After a brief break to gather our thoughts and set up new guests, the Scots Whay Hae! podcast returns. Number 18 sees Ali talking to TV's Colin McCredie about the best from Scottish Telly past. It's a big subject to cover, but we manage to touch on programmes from the 1960s to the present day. I'm sure we missed many people's favourites, but hopefully there's enough of interest to please everyone from casual watchers to Telly Addicts.</p>
